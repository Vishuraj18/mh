A military hospital is a hospital that is owned and operated by the armed forces.They are often
reserved for the use of military personnel and their dependents, but in some countries are made 
available to civilians as well. They may or may not be located on a military base; many are not.

In the United Kingdom and Germany, British military hospitals have been closed; military personnel
are usually treated in a special wing of a designated civilian hospital, in the UK, these are 
referred to as a Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit.Service personnel injured in combat operations 
are normally treated at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine.

As of 2018, there are 112 Military Hospitals, 12 Air Force Hospitals and 9 Naval Hospitals in India.
